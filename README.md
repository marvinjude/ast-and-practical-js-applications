## AST and Practical Applications in JavaScript

This repository contains a Babel and Eslint plugin from my article on [AST and Practical Applications in JavaScript](https://dev.to/marvinjude/abstract-syntax-trees-and-practical-applications-in-javascript-4a3). It aims to explain the concept of AST along with practical use cases in JavaScript land.

> This repository comprises two branches: `main` and `starter`. The `starter` branch serves as an empty template that we'll progressively build upon throughout the article. On the other hand, the `main` branch captures every modification we'll make to our `starter` branch. Feel free to cross-reference the `main` branch with your ongoing updates as necessary.
