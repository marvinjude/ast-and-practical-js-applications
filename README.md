## AST and Practical Applications in JavaScript

This repository contains a Babel and Eslint plugin from my arictle on [AST and Practical Applications in JavaScript](https://dev.to/marvinjude/soo-about-ast-and-code-transformation-5em3-temp-slug-7368593). It aims to explain the concept of AST along with pratical use cases in JavaScript land. 

Check out the article [here](https://dev.to/marvinjude/soo-about-ast-and-code-transformation-5em3-temp-slug-7368593)

> This repository comprises two branches: `main` and `starter`. The `starter` branch serves as an empty template that we'll progressively build upon throughout the article. On the other hand, the `main` branch captures every modification we'll make to our `starter` branch. Feel free to cross-reference the `main` branch with your ongoing updates as necessary.
